# Parliament Vote Analysis

### Data
- The folder `data/` contains all the vote data in xlsx or csv format.
- Run the script `xlsx-to-csv.py` to convert xlsx files to csv (the latter is much faster in pandas).

### Analysis
- The folder `sort-votes/` contains code to explore the votes sorted by Rice index.
